{t:Angels From the Realms of Glory}
{soc}
Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight o'er all the earth
Ye, who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King
{eoc}

Shepherds in the field abiding
Watching o'er your flocks by night
God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the infant Light
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King

Sages, leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar:
Seek the great Desire of nations
Ye have seen his natal star
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King

Saints before the altar bending
Watching long in hope and fear
Suddenly the Lord, descending
In His temple shall appear
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King
