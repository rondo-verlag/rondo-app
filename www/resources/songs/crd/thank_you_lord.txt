{t:Thank You, Lord}
[D]Oh Lord, I[Em] am amazed at Your lo[D]ve for m[G]e
[D]When I was lost and al[Em]one in the darkness
[D]You found m[G]e
[D]You have poured out Your in[Em]finite grace
[D]Lord, what can I s[G]ay?
[D]You are deserving of al[Em]l I can give
[G]You deserve all of my [A]praise

So I t[D]hank You, Lo[G]rd
I t[D]hank You, Lo[G]rd
I t[Bm7]hank You, Lor[G]d,
For Yo[A]ur great lo[D]ve  [Em][D][G]

[D]Oh Lord, h[Em]ow could I ever rep[D]ay Your lo[G]ve?
For y[D]ou have given the gr[Em]eatest treasure
Of a[D]ll, Your So[G]n
[D]You have shown me Your inti[Em]mate love
[D]Lord, what can I sa[G]y?
[D]You are deserving of a[Em]ll I can give
[G]You deserve all of my pr[A]aise
