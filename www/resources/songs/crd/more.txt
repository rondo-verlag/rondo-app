{t:More}
[A]More than oxygen, I need Your love
[A]More than life-giving food the hungry dream of
[A]More than an eloquent word depends on the tongue
[A]More than a passionate song needs to be sung

{soc}
More than a [D]word could ever [A]say
More than a [D]song could ever [A]convey
I need You m[D]ore than all of these t[F#m]hings
[D]Father, I need [A]you more
{eoc}

More than magnet and steel are drawn to unite
More than poets love words to rhyme as they write
More than the comforting warmth of sun in the spring
More than the eagle loved wind under its wings

{c:Chorus}

More than a blazing fire on a winter's night
More than the tall evergreens reach for the light
More than the pounding waves long for the shore
More than these gifts You give, I love You more

{c:Brian Doerkson}
