[G]  [G/B]There is a p[C]lace that I k[D]now [G]
Where I [G/B]need more of[C]ten to g[D]o [G]
[G/B]A place of [C]amazing c[D]omfort and rest[G][G/B][C][D][G]
Where a s[G/B]mile is nev[C]er ra[D]re [G]
And your l[G/B]ove is as fr[C]ee as the a[D]ir [G]
And[G/B] I lack for n[C]othing
[D]When I can s[Em]ee the lo[D/F#]ve in your e[G]yes
And kn[Am]ow that it's a[G/B]ll [C]for m[D]e

I fear [G]nothing at a[D]ll
When I'm sa[Am]fe in the arms of my F[C]ather [D]
And if e[G]ver I fa[D]ll
I take co[Am]mfort in knowing that
[C]You ar[D]e th[G]ere[G/B]    [C]  [D]
