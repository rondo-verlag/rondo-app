{t:My Tribute}
[Bb]How can I say [F6/A]thanks for the [Fm6/Ab]things You have [Gsus4]done for [G]me--
[Cm]Things so unde[Gaug/C]served, yet You [Cmin7]give to prove Your [Cdim7]love for [Ebmin7]me?
The [Bb/D]voices of a million [Gm]angels could not ex[Gm6/E]press my grati[Ebmin7]tude--
All that I [Bb/F]am and [Gm]ever hope to [G7]be,[Cm]
[Fsus4]I owe it [F]all to [Bb]Thee.

To [Bb]God be the [Dmin7]glo[G7]ry,
To [Cm]God be the [Cdim7]glo[F]ry;
To [D]God be the [Gsus4]glo[Gm]ry for the [Gm6/E]things he has [Fsus4]done.[F]
With His [Bb]blood He has [Dmin7]saved [G7]me;
With His [Cm]pow'r he has [Cdim7]raised [F]me;
To [D]God be the [Gsus4]glo[Gm]ry for the [Bb/F]things [Eb/F]he has [Bb]done.

Just let me [Gm]live my [D7]life; let it be [Gm]pleasing, Lord, to Thee.
And should I gain any [Gm/E]praise, let it go to [Cmaj7]Calvary.[Fsus4][F]

With His blood He has saved me;
With His pow'r he has raised me;
To God be the glory for the things he has done.
