{t:Obsession}
[Bm][A/Bm][G/Bm][Em]
What can I do with my obsession?
With the things I cannot see
Is there madness in my being?
Is it the wind that blows the trees?
Sometimes you're further than the moon
Sometimes you're closer than my skin
And you surround me like a winter fog
You've come and burned me with a kiss

And my [G]heart [A]burns for [D/F#]you
And my [G]heart [A]burns

[Bm][A/Bm][G/Bm][Em]
And I'm so filthy with my sin
I carry pride like a disease
You know I'm stubborn God and I'm longing to be close
You burn me deeper than I know
I feel lonely without hope
I feel desperate without vision
You wrap around me like a winter coat
you come and free me like a bird

And my [G]heart [A]burns for [D/F#]you
And my [G]heart [A]burns for [D]you
