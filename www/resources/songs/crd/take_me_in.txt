{t:Take Me In}
[E]Gently You c[A]ome
[A]Softly You [E]draw
[E]And my heart [A]burns
To know You [E]more

[E]Can this be t[A]rue?  Is it for [E]real?
That You would l[C]ove me
Heal me, f[D]ree me, take me [E]in  [A]

This broken reed
This flickering flame
You have redeemed
And freed from shame
Can this be true?  Is it for real?
That You would love me
Heal me, free me, take me in.

[E]And [G]I sur[A]render [E]all
[E]You, [G]You r[A]escued [E]me
[E]And [G]I give Y[A]ou my [E]all
[C]Love me, heal me, [D]free me, take me [E]in  [A]
