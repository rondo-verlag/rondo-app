[G]Jesus I [C]need to know [G]true love
Deeper than the lov[C]e found on [Dsus]earth [D]
[G]Take me in[C]to the King's ch[G]amber
[Am7]Cause my [D]love to ma[G]ture

Let me [G]know the kisses of your mouth
Let me feel your embrace
Let me smell the fragrance of your touch
Let me see your lovely face
[C]Take me away with you
Even so, Lord, [G]come
I [Am7]love you Lord,[C] I l[D]ove you more than [G]life
I [Am7]love you Lord,[C] I l[D]ove you more than [G]life

[G]My heart, my [C]flesh yearn for [G]you, Lord
To love you is [C]all I can [Dsus]do [D]
[G]You have be[C]come my sole [G]passion
[Am7]Cause my [D]love to be[G] true
