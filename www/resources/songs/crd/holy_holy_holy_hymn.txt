[C]Holy, [Am]Holy, [G]Hol[C]y! [F]Lord God [C]Almighty
[G/B]Early [C]in [G/B]the [Am]morn[G]ing our song shall [D]rise to [G]Thee
[C]Holy, [Am]Holy, [G]Hol[C]y! [F]Merciful and [C]migh[C/B]ty
[Am]God [C/G]in three [F]per[C/E]sons, [F]Blessed [G]Trini[C]ty

Holy, Holy, Holy! All the saints adore Thee
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee
Which wert and art, and evermore shall be

Holy, Holy, Holy! Though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee
Perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity
