{t:You Are In Control}
[D]You are my shepherd, I have no needs
You lead me by peaceful streams
And y[G]ou re[A]fresh my li[D]fe

You hold my hand and you guide my steps
I could walk throught the valley of death
And I[G] won't [A]be af[D]raid

{soc}
Because y[G]ou are [A]in cont[D]rol
Because y[G]ou are [A]in cont[D]rol
Because y[G]ou are [A]in cont[D]rol
[G]You are [A]in cont[D]rol
{eoc}

[C] You cause everything to [G]work to[D]gether
[C] You truly have a [G]sovereign [D]plan

And you [Em]know wh[D]o I [G]am
And you [Em]made wh[D]o I [G]am
And you [Em]love wh[D]o I [G]am
