[G]Let all who are [C]weak
[Em]All who are [C]weary
[G]Come to the [C]Rock
[Em]Come to the [C]Fountain
[G]All who have [C]sailed
[Em]On the rivers of [C]heartache
[G]Come to the [C]sea,
[Em]Come on, and [C]be set free!

If You [G]lead me Lord, I will [C]follow
Where You [Em]lead me Lord, I will [C]go 
Come, and [G]heal me Lord, I will [C]follow
Where You [Em]lead me Lord, I will [C]go
I will [G]go
{eoc}

Let all who are weak
All who are weary
Come to the Rock
Come to the Fountain
Let all who have climbed
The mountains of heartbreak
Reach to the sky
Come on, and give your life
