{t:Apostle's Creed}
[D]We believe in God the Father
Almighty mak[G]er of the heavens and the earth
And in [D]Jesus Christ His Son
Who was conc[G]eived by the Holy Spirit
And given [Em7]birth
We bel[G]ieve, we belie[D]ve
We beli[Em7]eve, we bel[G]ieve, we belie[D]ve

He was born of the virgin Mary
And He suffered under Pontius Pilate
He was crucified and dead and buried
He descended to the depths of hell
And He rose again,
We believe, we believe
We believe, we believe, we believe

W[Am7]e believe He sends His Spirit
on His [D]church with grace and power
W[Am7]e believe He pours His Spirit
on His [D]church this final hour

He ascended to the highest heavens
And is seated at the right hand of God
He will come again to judge the living
Yes, He will come again to judge the living
And to judge the dead,
We believe, we believe
We believe, we believe, we believe

We be[D]lieve in the Holy Spirit
We be[Am7]lieve in the [G]Holy Christian [D]Church
We be[D]lieve in the communion of saints
We be[Am7]lieve in the [G]forgiveness of [D]sins
And the resurrection
We believe, we believe
In the life eternal,
We believe, we believe

We believe He sends His Spirit
on His church with grace and power
We believe He pours His Spirit
on His church this final hour
