{t:Lead Me to the Father}
My heart wa[G]its [Em]with expect[C]ation
A l[G]onging for lo[Em]ve, ins[C]atiable desire
Jesus le[G]ad m[Em]e to[C] the Father's arms
His c[G]omforting wo[Em]rds build h[C]ope to carry on

[Am]How can I li[C]ve without your ge[G]ntle soothing voi[D]ce?
[Am]Where can I g[C]o to know the fru[G]its of love and jo[D]y?

[G]Lead[G/E] me to the Fa[C]ther
[G]Lead[G/E] me to the Fa[C]ther

Bring my heart to the point of least resistance
A place of simple trust and one of simple faith
Only you can take me to His home
Where we will be united, His promises fulfilled
