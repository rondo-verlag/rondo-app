{t:All Heaven Declares}
[A]All heav'n [D]declares [Esus4]
The [E]glory of the [D/A]risen [A]Lord
Who can com[D]pare [Esus4]
[E]With the beauty [D/A]of the [A]Lord?
Forever he will [D]be [E]
The Lamb upon the [A]throne [E/G#][F#m7]
I gladly bow my [D]knee [E7]
And worship him [A]alone [D/A][A]

I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain
To reconcile us to God
Forever you will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
And worship you alone
