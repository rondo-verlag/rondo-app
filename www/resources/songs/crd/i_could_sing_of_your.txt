{title:I Could Sing of Your Love Forever}
[E] Over the mountains and the sea
[F#m7] Your river runs with love for me
[A] And I will open up my heart
[Bsus] And let the healer set me free
[E] I'm happy to be in the truth
[F#m7] And I will daily lift my hands
[A] For I will always sing of [Bsus]when your love came down

{start_of_chorus}
[E] I could sing of your lov[F#m7]e forever
[A] I could sing of your lov[Bsus]e forever
[E] I could sing of your lov[F#m7]e forever
[A] I could sing of your lov[Bsus]e forever
{end_of_chorus}

{gc:Bridge:}
[F#m7] Oh I feel like [E/G#]dancing
[A] It's foolishness I [Bsus]know
[F#m7] But when the world has [E/G#]seen the light
They will [A]dance with joy like we're da[Bsus]ncing now
