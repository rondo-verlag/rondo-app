{t:Daniel's Prayer}
[C]Oh Lord, you are the great and [D]awesome God
[C]Oh Lord, you are the righteous and [D]Holy One
[Am]Yet we have sinned[G], turned awa[C]y from your wa[D]ys
[Am]Yes we have sinned[G], walked awa[C]y from your wa[D]ys
We have not li[Em]stened to your ser[C]vants
We have not li[Em]stened

Now oh [C]Lord, hear our prayer, [D]hear our cry
Oh [C]Lord, open your eyes and [D]see our desolation
[Am]We do not pra[G]y because we are right[C]eous, oh Lo[D]rd
[Am]But because of you[G]r great mercy,[C] we pray[D]

Oh [Em]Lord, [D] [G]listen (listen)
Oh [Em]Lord, [Am]forgive ([Dsus]for[D]give)
Oh [G]Lord, [F]hear and act
[C]For your sake, do [G]not delay
Oh Lo[C]rd, [D][C]hear our cry[Em]
For [C]we bear your name [Em]
