{t:Lover of My Soul}
When l[Dsus]iving here has cause[D]d me pain
Things I j[Dsus]ust don't understan[D]d
I m[Dsus]ust recount your fai[D]thfulness
And the m[Dsus]ercy of your hand[D]

When ev[Dsus]erything is sai[D]d and done
And there's n[Dsus]othing left to sa[D]y
The cro[Dsus]ss of Christ is pro[D]of enough
You are[Dsus] good, [D]you are good,[G] you are good [Dsus][D][Dsus][D]

Your mercy Lord has pierced my heart
It brings me to my knees
In reverent fear I'll trust your ways
And worship at your feet

{soc}
You're the lov[C]er of m[G]y soul[D]
You're the kee[C]per of m[G]y heart[D]
And I k[C]now that you're st[G]anding here, oh[D] Lord
We will n[C]ever, no n[G]ever be apart[D]
{eoc}

[Dsus]Oh to b[D]e the frien[Dsus]d of God[D]
How swee[Dsus]t to be[D] the friend[Dsus] of God[D]
