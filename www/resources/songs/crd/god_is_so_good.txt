[G]He rides upon the wings of the wind
[G]He is exalted by His name Jah
[G]He walks in the midst of the stones of fire
[G]To be His sons is our desire

[Em] For the natural thin[D]gs
[Em] speak of the in[C]visible[D][C][D]
[Em] Look around and see[D]
[Em] Who could deny [C] the won[D]ders
[Dsus]Of     [D]His [G]love?

You reign on high in majesty
And the widow's heart causes to sing
You hear the cry of the fatherless
And the depths of Your love who can comprehend?
