[E][F#m][A][E]
This is my c[F#m]ry, [A]this is my s[E]ong
You are my gu[F#m]iding light
[A]When the way is unk[E]nown
And when these s[F#m]unny skies [A]turn 
shades of g[E]ray
I'll stay close b[F#m]y your side
[A]As You lead the w[E]ay

{soc}
Jesus lead o[D]n,[A] I will fo[E]llow
Jesus lead o[D]n
Let your lo[A]ve light the w[E]ay
Jesus lead o[D]n [A]I will fol[E]low
Jesus lead o[D]n[A][G][E]
{eoc}

Hear now this cry, Hear now this song
You are the guiding light for this 
journey I'm on
And when my vision is clouded
By the wind and the rain
I'll stay close by your side
As you lead the way
