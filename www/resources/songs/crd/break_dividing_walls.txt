{title:Break Dividing Walls}
[G]        [C2]
[G]There is a place of com[C]manded blessing
Where b[G]retheren in unity [D]dwell
A [G]place where anointing [C]oil is flowing
Where [G]we l[D]ive as o[G]ne

You have called us to be a body
You have called us as friends
Joined together in the bond of the Spirit
Unto the end

[C]Father we join with the [G/B]prayer of Jesus
[C] As You are so [G/B]let us be one
[C]Joined together in [G/B]unity and purpose
[Am7]All for the love of Your [C]Son

{start_of_chorus}
We will [G]break dividing walls
We will [C]break dividing walls
We will [G]break dividing walls in the [D]Name of Your Son
We will [G]break dividing walls
We will [C]break dividing walls
And [G]we [D]will be [G]one
