{t:Shout to the Lord}
{su:Joshua 6:20}
[G][C][G][Dsus][D]
[G][C][G][D7sus][G][D7sus]
[G] We are His [C]people
[G] He gives us [Dsus]music to [D]sing
[G] There is a [C]sound now
Like the [G]sound of the [D7sus]Lord, when His [G]enemies [D7sus]flee
[G] But there is a [C]cry in our hearts
[G] Like when deep calls [Dsus]unto the [D]deep
[G] For Your breath of de[C]liv'rance
To [G]breathe on the [D7sus]music we so [G]desp'rately [D7sus]need

[Am7] But without Your [Dsus]power[D]
[Am7] All we have are these [Dsus]simple [D]songs
[Am7] If You'd step down from [Dsus]hea[D]ven
[G/D]Then the gates of [D]
[C/D]Would surely [D]fall

{soc}
[G]Shout to the Lord, [C]shout to the Lord,
[G]Shout to the Lord of [D7sus]hosts
[G]Shout to the Lord, [C]shout to the Lord,
[G]Shout to the [D]Lord of [G]hosts
[D]And it [G]breaks the heavy yoke, [C]breaks the heavy yoke
When you [G]shout, you shout to the [D7sus]Lord[D]
It [G]breaks the heavy yoke, [C]breaks the heavy yoke
When you [G]shout, you [D]shout to the [G]Lord
{eoc}

W[D7sus]oah,[G]      you [D7sus]shout to the [G]Lord,
Y[D7sus]eah,[G]      you [D7sus]shout to the [G]Lord...
[G] La [G2sus]la,   la,   la [G]la [G2sus]la [G]la...

(So we say:) [C/G]"Yes, [G]Lord,    [Am/G]yes, [G]Lord."
