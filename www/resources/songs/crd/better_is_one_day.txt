{title:Better Is One Day}
[E]How lovely is Your dwelling place
[A]O Lord [B]Almighty
[E]My soul longs and even faints for [B]You
[E]For here my heart is satisfied
[A]Within Your [B]presence
[E]I sing beneath the shadow of Your [B]wings

{soc}
[A]Better is one day in Your courts 
[B]Better is one day in Your house
[A]Better is one day in Your courts
[B]Than thousands elsewhere
{eoc}

One thing I ask, and would seek
To see your beauty
To find you in the place Your glory dwells

[C#m]My heart and flesh cry out[B][A]
For You, the living God[B][C#m]
Your Spirit's water [B]for my [A]soul[B][C#m]
I've tasted and I've seen[B][A]
Come once again to me
[E/G#]I will draw near to You
[F#m]I will draw near to You
[A][B]
