{t:What Child Is This?}
What c[Em]hild is t[G]his who l[D]aid to re[Bm]st
On M[Em]ary's la[Am]p is sle[B]eping?
Whom [Em]angels gr[G]eet with an[D]thems sw[Bm]eet
While she[Em]pherds wa[B]tch are k[Em]eeping?

{soc}
Thi[G]s, this is Chr[D]ist the King
Whom s[Em]hepher[Am]ds guard and a[B]ngels sing
Has[G]te, haste to br[D]ing him Laud
The b[Em]abe, the s[B7]on of M[Em]ary
{eoc}

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here
The silent word is pleading

So br[Em]ing him in[G]cense, go[D]ld, and my[Bm]rrh
Come pe[Em]asant, K[Am]ing, to ow[B]n him
The Ki[Em]ng of K[G]ings salva[D]tion b[Bm]rings
Let lo[Em]ving hea[B]rts enth[Em]rone him
