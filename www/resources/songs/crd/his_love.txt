{t:His Love}
His [E]love is [A]higher than the [E]highest of [B]mountains.
His [E]love goes [A]deeper than the [E]deepest of [B]seas.
His [E]love it [A]stretches to the [E]farthest ho[B]rizons.
And His [A]love, it reaches to [E]me.

His love is stronger than the angels and demons.
His love it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.
His love secures me on the pathway to heaven.
And His love, is my strength and power.

His love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.
His love is better than the choicest of wine.
His love it satisfies the deepest of hunger,
And His love in Jesus it's mine.

Your love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.
Your love is better than the choicest of wine.
Your love it satisfies the deepest of hunger,
And Your love, in Jesus it's mine.

Your love is stronger than the angels and demons.
Your love it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.
Your love secures me on the parthway to heaven.
Your love is my strength and power.
