{t:The Heart of Worship}
[D]When the music fa[A]des, and all is stripped away[Em]
And I simply [A7sus4]come
Long[D]ing just to bring [A] something that's of worth[Em]
That will bless your [A7sus4]heart

[Em]I'll bring you more than a song[A], for a song in itself[Em]
Is not what yo[D/F#]u have requi[A]red   [A/C#][D]
[Em]You search much de[D/F#]eper within[A], than the way things appe[Em]ar
You're looking in[D/F#]to my heart[A]

{soc}
[D]I'm coming back to the hear[A2/C#]t of worship
And it's a[Em]ll about you, all a[G]bout you[A], Jesus
[D]I'm sorry, Lord, for the thi[A2/C#]ngs I've made it
When it's a[Em]ll about you, all a[G]bout you[A], Jesus [D]
{eoc}

King of endless worth, no one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours
Every single breath

{c:Matt Redman}
