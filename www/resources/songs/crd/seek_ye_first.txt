{t:Seek Ye First}
[D]Seek ye fi[F#m]rst the ki[G]ngdom of G[D]od
[G]And his [D]righteousne[A7]ss
[D]And all these th[F#m]ings shall be ad[G]ded unto y[D]ou
[G]Hal[D]lelu, hallelu[A7]jah[D]!

You shall not live by bread alone
But by ev'ry word
That proceeds from the mouth of God
Hallelu, hallelujah!

Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and you shall find
Knock and it shall be opened unto you
Hallelu, hallelujah!

Trust in the Lord with all your heart
He shall direct your paths
In all your ways acknowledge him
Hallelu, hallelujah!
