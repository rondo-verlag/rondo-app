{t:Angels Dancing}
[A][E]
[A]Angels dancing 'round
As I hear the sound of y[E]ou
[Asus]Is this you draw[A]ing near?
Oh Lo[Asus]rd, please come t[A]ake away my fe[E]ar
To o[C#m] - pen u[B]p agai[A]n
My f[E]riend

There is no place I'd rather be[A]
Oh Lord, than here beholding Th[C#m]ee
Open up my eyes so I can s[B]ee
Your beauty Lord, your beauty Lo[E]rd
When I am weak Lord, you are st[A]rong
Help me through the day when it is l[C#m]ong
I run into your open arms of lo[B]ve

[E]The way you move takes away my fe[A]ar
The way you move lets me know you're ne[C#m]ar
The way you move satisfies my so[B]ul
The way you move, it makes me wh[E]ole
The way you move touches deep ins[A]ide
The way you move, I can't hi[C#m] - de
From your pres[B]ence
