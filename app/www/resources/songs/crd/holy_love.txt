{t:Holy Love}
[A]
[D]Many waters cannot quench your love, [Bm7]rivers cannot overwhelm it
[Esus]Oceans of fe[E]ar [Esus]cannot con[E]ceal your [A]love for me
[D]Many waters cannot quench your love, [Bm7]rivers cannot overwhelm it
[Esus]Oceans of fe[E]ar [Esus]cannot con[E]ceal your [A]love for me
Your [E]love for me [E/F#][E/G#]

{soc}
[D]Holy love, [A/C#]flow in me [A/B][A]
[D]Fill me up [D/E][D/F#]
Like the [A/E]deepest sea [E][D/F#][E/G#]
Like a [D]crashing wave pouring [A/C#]over me [A/B][A]
[D]Holy love flow in [A]me
{eoc}

Many sorrows cannot quench your love, darkness cannot overwhelm it
I will not fear, your love is here to comfort me
Many sorrows cannot quench your love, darkness cannot overwhelm it
I will not fear, your love is here to comfort me
You comfort me

{c:Chorus}

{c:Bridge}
[A]When I find you I find [D]healing
[E]When I find you I find [A]peace [A/B][A]
And I know that there's no [D]river so wide
No [E]mountain so high
No [D/F#]ocean so deep
That you can't [Esus]part the [E]sea [D/F#][E/G#]
