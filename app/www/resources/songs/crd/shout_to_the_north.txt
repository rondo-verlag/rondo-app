In your [G]broken[D]ness com[C]plete

Rise up women of the truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our awesome King of love

{c:Chorus}

[Em]We've been through fire, [C]we've been through rain
[Em]We've been refined by the po[C]wer of his name
[Em]We've fallen deeper i[C]n love with you
You've burned the truth on our l[D]ips

{c:Chorus}

Rise up church with broken wings
Fill this place with songs again
Of our God who reigns on high
By his grace again we'll fly
