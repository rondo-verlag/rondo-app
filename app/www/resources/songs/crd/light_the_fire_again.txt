{t:Light the Fire Again}
[F][C][Gm][Bb]
[F] Don't let my lo[C]ve grow cold
I'm [Gm]calling out, [Bb]light the fire again
[F] Don't let my vi[C]sion die
I'm [Gm]calling out, [Bb]light the fire again

You know my heart, my deeds
I'm calling out, light the fire again
I need Your discipline
I'm calling out, light the fire again

[Gm]I am here to buy g[Dm]old re[Bb/D]fined in the fi[C]re
Na[Bb]ked and poor, wretch[F/A]ed and blind, I come[C]
Clothe me in whit[Eb]e[Bb/D]
So I won't b[Csus]e ashamed
[Bb]Lord light the [F]fire again [C][Gm][Bb]
