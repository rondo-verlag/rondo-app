{t:Meet With Me}
[A]I'm [D]here to [E]meet with [A]You
[A]Come [D]and [E]meet with [A]me
[A]I'm [D]here to [E]find [A]You
[A]Re[D]veal Your[E]self to [A]me

As I [A]wait,[D] You [E]make me [A]strong
As I long, You draw me to Your arms
As I stand and sing Your praise
You come, You come and You fill this place
Won't You come, Won't You come and fill this place
