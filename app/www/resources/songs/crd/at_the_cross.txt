{t:At the Cross}
[E]I know a p[Bm7]lace
A w[A]onderful p[E]lace
Where accused and con[Bm7]demned
Find m[A]ercy and g[E]race
Where the w[E]rongs we have [Bm7]done
And the w[A]rongs done to u[E]s
Were nailed there with h[Bm7]im 
T[A]here on the c[E]ross

{soc}
At the [D]cross [A]
He [G]died for our [E]sins
At the [D]cross [A]
He [G]gave us life [E]again
{eoc}
