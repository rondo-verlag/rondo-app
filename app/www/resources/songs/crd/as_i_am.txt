{t:As I Am}
[A][C#m]
Mary, she [A]knows
In a [C#m]world that's dark, torn apart at the [A]seams
She [C#m]lifts up her eyes
Up to the skies and [A]sings
"I am my beloved's
And he loves me as I am"

Sometimes I cry
'Cause the world, it's dark, torn apart at the seams
I lift up my eyes
Up to the skies and sing
"I am my beloved's
My beloved's
I am my beloved's
And he loves me as I am
My beloved's
Yes he loves me as I am
As I am"

Sometimes it's hard
Though patiently you look for the time to see
Whose are you?  (tell me)
Whose are you?
I am my beloved's
My beloved's
I, I, I am my beloved's
And he loves me as I am
My beloved's
Yes he loves me as I am
As I am

Light of the world
Come shine on, please
Come shine on me

Sometimes I cry
'Cause the world it's dark torn apart at the seams
For I am weak
Sometimes I cry
For I am weak
I am my beloved's
My beloved's
I, I, I am my beloved's
And he loves me as I am
My beloved's
Yes he loves me as I am
Loves me as I am

Light of the world
Come shine on, please
Come shine on me
