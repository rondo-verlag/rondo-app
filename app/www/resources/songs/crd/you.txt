{t:You}
[Dsus]In eve[D]ry country [Dsus][D]
[Dsus]in eve[D]ry nation [Dsus][D]
[G/B]From many tribes in al[Dsus]l of cre[D]ation [Dsus][D]
[Bm7]Someone is kneeling, so[D]meone is dancing
[G/B]Someone is worshiping You

From ocean to ocean, from mountain to mountain
In the dance of the children, in the voice of a thousand
Someone is bowing, someone is shouting
Someone is worshipping You

{soc}
It's Y[D]ou and You alo[Bm7]ne in many tongue conf[G/B]essions
It's Y[D]ou and You alo[Bm7]ne, always and fore[G/B]ver... Yo[Dsus]u    [D]
{eoc}

From the heart of the orphan, raised hands of the lame
In the cry of the outcast, on the lips of the shamed
Someone is weeping, someone is blessing
Someone is worshipping You

{c:Chorus}

[D]Lord, we will bow down and lay our crowns down
Lord, we will worship You
Dancing and singing, choruses ringing
Lord, we will worship You
With joy and laughter forever after
Lord, we will worship You
In love and freedom, we come as one
Lord, we will worship You
