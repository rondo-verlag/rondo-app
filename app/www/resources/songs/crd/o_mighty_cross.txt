{title:O, Mighty Cross}
O, [G7sus]mighty [C]cross, live [G/C]lifted [Cmaj7/E]high
The Lord of [Dm7]life raised there to [G7sus]die[G]
His [C/E]sacrif[F]ice on [G]Calva[Am7]ry
Has made the [Dm7]mighty cross[C/E] a [F]tree of [G7sus]life to [C]me

O, mighty cross, what throne of grace
He knew no sin, yet took my place
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

O, mighty cross, O Christ, so pure
Love held Him there, such shame endured
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

O, mighty cross, my soul's release
The stripes He bore, have brought me peace
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me
