[A][E][E2][E]
(Oh yes) the [A]victo[E]ry [E2]is the Lord's
The [A]victo[E]ry [E2]is the Lord's
We've [A]just begun to [E]fight  (ooh)
We've [A]just begun to [E]fight  (ooh)

And [F#m]when I get dis[G#m]couraged, Having [A]done all then I stand
He gave us [F#m]weapons to fight, And the [G#m]Spirit of might
[A]I feel the power, the [Bsus]Word of the Lord  [B][A]

{start_of_chorus}
[E]Where is the Lord[A] God of Eli[E]jah?
El[E]ohim, my Re[A]deemer and my [B]Friend
[A]Any [E]weapon formed again[A]st me will not [E]prosper
And His [F#m]eyes are a flame of [G#m]fire
And His [A]will is my des[Bsus]ire
{end_of_chorus}

{guitar_comment:End, slower:}
And His [F#m]eyes are a flame of [G#m]fire
And His [A]will is my des[Bsus]ire
Well the [A]victo[E]ry [E2]is the Lord's
The [A]victo[E]ry [E2]is the Lord's
