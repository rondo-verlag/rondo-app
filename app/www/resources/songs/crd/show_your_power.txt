Well [G]He is the Lord and [C]He reigns on [G]high
[D]He is the [G]Lord

[D]He is the [G]Lord

Who is [G]like unto Him never [C]ending in [G]days
[D]He is the [G]Lord
And [G]He comes in power when we [C]call on His [G]name
[D]He is the [G]Lord

Your gospel oh Lord is the hope for our nation
You are the Lord
Its the power of God for our salvation
You are the Lord

We ask not for riches but look to the cross
You are the Lord
And for our inheritence give us the lost
You are the Lord
