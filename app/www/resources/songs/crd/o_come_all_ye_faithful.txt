{t:O Come, All Ye Faithful}
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God, all glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
