{t:To God Be the Glory!}
To God be the glory! great things he hath done;
So loved he the world that he gave us his Son;
Who yielded his life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.
{soc}
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear his voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice:
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give him the glory; great things he hath done!
{eoc}

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!
To ev'ry believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes
That monment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our rapture, when Jesus we see.
