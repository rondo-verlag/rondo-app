{t:Shout to the Lord}
[A]My Jesus,[E] my Savior
[F#m]Lord there is no[E]ne like Yo[D]u
[D]All of my da[A/C#]ys
[D]I want to pr[A/C#]aise
The wonders of Your [G]migh[G/F#]ty [E]love

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath
All that I am
Never cease to worship You

{soc}
[A]Shout to the Lo[F#m]rd all the ea[D]rth let us si[E]ng
[A]Power and ma[F#m]jesty, pr[D]aise to the Ki[E]ng
[F#m]Mountains bow down and the se[D]as will roar
At the [E]sound of Your Name
[A]I sing for jo[F#m]y at the wo[D]rk of Your ha[E]nds
[A]Forever I'll lo[F#m]ve You, for[D]ever I'll st[E]and
[A]Nothing com[F#m]pares to the pr[D]omise I ha[E]ve in You [A]
