{t:There Is a Redeemer}
[D]There is [A]a [D]re[G]deem[D]er
[A]Je[D]sus [G]God's [A]own [D]Son[A]
[D]Precious [A]Lamb [D]of [G]God, Me[A7/F#]ssiah
[G]Ho[A]ly [D]One

Jesus my redeemer
Name above all names
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Oh for sinners slain

{soc}
[D]Thank You [D/F#]oh my [G]Fa[D]ther
For [G]giving us [A]Your [D]Son[A]
And [D]leav[A]ing [D]Your [G]Spirit [D/F#]'till
The [G/E]work on [A]earth is [D]done
{eoc}

When I stand in glory
I will see His face
And there I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place
