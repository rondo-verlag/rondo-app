{t:Hungry}
{su:Falling On My Knees}
[C]Hungry, I come t[Am7]o You for I kn[G]ow You satis[F]fy
[C]I am empty, b[Am7]ut I know Your lo[G]ve does not run d[F]ry
And so I [G]wait for Y[F/A]ou so I [G/B]wait for Yo[F]u

{soc}
I'm [C]falling on my kn[Fmaj7]ees
Off[C]ering all of [Fmaj7]me
Jes[C]us, You're all this [Fmaj7]heart is living for[C]
{eoc}

Broken, I run to You for Your arms are open wide
I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life
And so I wait for You so I wait for You
