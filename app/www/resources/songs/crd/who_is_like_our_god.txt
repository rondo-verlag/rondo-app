[C] Who is [D]like our [G]God [C][G][C]

Who is like our God
Who is like our God
Mighty and innocent, jealous and kind
Sovereign and merciful
Who is like our God

[D] All of man's glo[C]ry fades away [Em]
Like a spring flo[D]wer in the rain [Am]
No fallen an[Em]gel is wo[D/F#]rthy to be worship[G]ped
Nor [F]anything creat[D]ed

Who is like our God
Who is like our God
