{t:We Will Ride}
[D]He has fire in his eyes and a sword in his hand
And he's riding a white horse across this land
He has [G]fire in his eyes and a sword in his hand
And he's [D]riding a white horse across this land
And he's [A]calling out to you and me
"Will you ride with [D]me?"

[D]He has fire in his eyes and a sword in his hand
And he's riding a white horse across this land
And he's [G]calling out to you and me
"Will you ride with [D]me?"
We say [A]"Yes, yes Lord, we will ride with [D]you"

{soc}
We say, [D]"Yes Lord, we [G]will ride [D]with you[G]
[D]We will stand up and fight
We will [G]ride with the armies of heaven
We'll be dressed in [D]white", "Well be dressed in white"
We say, [A]"Yes, yes Lord, we will [D]ride"
{eoc}

He has a crown on his head
He carries a sceptor in his hand
And he's leading the armies across this land
And he's calling out to you and me
Will you ride with me?"
We say, Yes, yes Lord
We will ride with you

That fire in his eyes is his love for his bride
And he's longing that she be with him
Right by his side
That fire in his eyes is his burning desire
That his bride be with him, right by his side
And he's calling out to us right now,
"Will you ride with me?"

[G]Yes [D]Lord, [G6/D]yes [D]Lord
[G]Yes [D]Lord, [G6/D]yes [D]Lord
