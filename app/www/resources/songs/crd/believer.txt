[A7]I dream of tongues of fire
[A7sus]Resting on Your people
[C]I dream of all the [Em]miracles to come
[A7]I hope to see the coming
[A7sus]Healing of the nations
[C]I long to see the [Em]prodigals return
[Fsus]So many [Dsus]hopes and longings in You
[Fsus]When will all the [Dsus]dreams come true?

[A]I'm a [G]believer in Your Kingdom
[D/F#]I am a [G]seeker of the new things
[A]I am a [G]dreamer with some old dreams
[D/F#]Let them [G]now [A]come (Will You now come)
{eoc}

I hope to see You come down
Rend the mighty heavens
And let Your glory cover all the earth
To see your sons and daughters
Come to know and love You
And find a purer passion in the church
These are the things my heart will pursue
When will all the dreams come true?

May Your church now reach out
Sowing truth and justice
Learn to love the poor and help the weak
When Your Kingdom's coming
It will touch the broken
Place the lonely in a family
So many hopes and longings in You
When will all the dreams come true?
