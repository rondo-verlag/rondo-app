{t:Our God Reigns}
[G]How lovely [C]on the [D]mountains are the [C]feet of [G]him
Who brings good [Am]news,[D] good [G]news[G7]
Announcing [C]peace, pro[D]claiming words of [C]happin[G]ess
Our God [Am]reigns,[D] our God [G]reigns[G7]

{soc}
Our God [C]reigns, our God [G]reigns
Our God [C]reig[D]ns, our God [G]reigns
{eoc}

You watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one
Shout for your King, your King
See eye to eye, the Lord restoring Zion
Our God reigns, our God reigns

Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy
We are redeemed, redeemed
The Lord has saved and comforted His people
Our God reigns, our God reigns

Ends of the earth, see the salvation of your God
Jesus is Lord, is Lord
Before the nations he has bared his holy arm
Our God reigns, our God reigns
