{t:Psalm 121}
{su:I Lift My Eyes Up}
[C]   I lift my [F]eyes up [C] to the [F]mountains
[C]   Where does my [F]help [C]come [G]from?
[C]   My help comes [F]from You, [C] Maker of [F]Heaven
[C]   Creator [F]of [C]the [G]earth
{c:repeat}

[C/E]   O how I [F]need You Lord, [C/E] You are my [F]only hope
[C/E]   You're my [F]on[C]ly [G]prayer
[C/E]   So I will [F]wait for You [C/E] to come and [F]rescue me
[C/E]   Come and [F]give [C]me [G]life
