{t:Grace Dance}
[G][G/B][C][G]
Wh[G]en [G/B]I call[C] on your [G]name
There's [G/B]no hid[C]ing in [G]shame
Wh[G]en [G/B]I'm show[C]ered with [G]lies
I [G/B]just [C]look in your [G]eyes
For I[F] am [G]clean, your[F] blood has set me [A]free

{soc}
And I will da[G]nce with all my heart, da[C]nce with all my soul
[G]Dance with all my strength for y[D]ou have made me whole
I will da[G]nce with my all my heart, da[C]nce in jubilee
[G]Dance with all my soul, c[D]ome Lord dance with me
{eoc}

I'll dance and praise your name for you defeated shame
You have torn my chains and I am clean again
I will dance with all my heart, dance with all my soul
Dance with all my strength for you have made me whole

When I ponder the cross, I count all things as lost
Lord you are my desire, your love holy fire
For I am clean, your blood has set me free
