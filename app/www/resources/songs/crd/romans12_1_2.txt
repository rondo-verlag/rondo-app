[F#]I urge you, brothers and [E]sisters
[F#]I urge you, brothers and [E]sisters
[F#]I urge you, brothers and [E]sisters
[D]In view of [E]God's many merices

Offer your minds and your bodies
Offer your minds and your bodies
Offer your minds and your bodies
Your lives, your actions for service

Don't let the culture conform you
Don't let the culture conform you
Don't let the culture conform you
Let God renew and transform you

Just learn of Him and His purpose
Just learn of Him and His purpose
Just learn of Him and His purpose
And everything good and perfect
