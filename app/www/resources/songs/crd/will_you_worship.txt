{t:Will You Worship}
[F]Deep in my soul is a tug of war
I'm [Bb]struggling to know what [Csus]this life is for
[F]I try so hard to stay in control
To [Bb]hold back the tears, [Csus]to not let go
[Eb]I don't know why I [Bb]hang on so long
When I [Gm7]know the question [F]you are asking me[C]

{soc}
[F] Will you worship, will you bow down
Befor[Bb]e your Lord and King?[F][C]
[F] Will you love me, will you give me
Your hear[Bb]t, your everything?[F][C]
{c:repeat}
{eoc}

[Eb]Right here and now, [Bb]I make my choice
With [Gm7]all my love [F]I will answer you [C]

{soc}
[G] I will worship, I will bow down
Befor[C]e my Lord and King[G][D]
[G] I will love you, I will give you
My hear[C]t, my everything?[G]
{c:repeat}
{eoc}
